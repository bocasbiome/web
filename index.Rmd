This site provides reproducible workflows for the study on the gut microbiome of Caribbean butterflyfish. If you want to follow the workflow step-by-step, please use the navigation bar above or the section below, where scripts are presented in order. If you would instead like to jump to specific analyses, please select an area on the **clickable image map** to go directly to that section.

## Acknowledgements {.appendix}

We thank Lucia Rodriguez for field assistance, Joan Antaneda for her help in the laboratory, Ross Whippo for conducting the fish survey and Clare Fieseler for taking photos of the benthos. The staff of the Bocas del Toro Research Station provided logistical support. We are grateful to Kristin Saltonstall and Marta Vargas for their support at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute’s (STRI) Ecological and Evolutionary Genomics Laboratory. Friederike Clever was supported by a Smithsonian Short Term Fellowship. This project was funded, in part, by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore foundation to STRI and UC Davis (PIs: William Wcislo and Jonathan Eisen; http://doi.org/10.37807/GBMF5603) and a PhD studentship by Manchester Metropolitan University to Friederike Clever. A research permit was issued by the Ministerio de Ambiente Panamá (No. SE/A-113-17).

## Author Contributions {.appendix}

FC, ML, and JJS conceived the study. ML, FC, and RFP designed the study with input from AHA. FC, ML, and JJS conducted the fieldwork. ECRG and FC dissected the fish guts. FC extracted the DNA. JS and ML prepared the DNA for sequencing and processed the sequencing data. RFP, AHA, WOM, and ML contributed reagents and supplies. ECRG analysed the photographic benthic quadrats. FC, JS, and ML analysed the data and wrote the first draft of the manuscript with input from RFP and LGEW. All authors reviewed the manuscript and contributed to the final version. JJS and FC created the site.

## Data Availability {.appendix}

Sequencing data has been submitted to the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under project number XXX.
